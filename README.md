# Memory Game Project

This is the Memory Game or the Matching Game.

For this game you will need a PC, tablet or phone with a browser.

Goal: find all matching pairs of cards. Less moves is better.

Instructions:

Click on any card on the field, try to quickly memorize the picture, then click
on another card. When the second card is open:
- if cards match (hooray!) they change color and stay opened on the field;
- if cards do not match they hide after a little delay.

Continue opening pairs of cards until the deck is filled with matching
cards.

If during the game you want to restart the game you can click on restart image
close to the upper right corner of the field. Mind that your progress will be
lost if you decide to restart.

Good luck!
